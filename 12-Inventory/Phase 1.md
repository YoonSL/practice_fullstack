# Phase 1: Inventory App Models

* Go through all the files and trace their paths. Read through all the code to get an understanding of what's there. Code that's missing will have a comment saying in which section it needs to be added

* The goal for this phase is to write three API routes and your inventory mongoose model. First, create your inventory mongoose model. Use previous activities as a guide.

    * Your model must include one field called `itemName`. It needs to be a string, it must be unique, and it must be required and have an error message if it is not included.

    * Your model must include another field called `itemCount`. It needs to be a string, and it must be required and have an error message if it is not included.

    * Your model must include another field called `itemID`. It needs to be a string, it must be unique, and it must be required and have an error message if it is not included.
