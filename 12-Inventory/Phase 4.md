# Phase 4: Inventory App AJAX

* For this phase, open the `app.js` file in the `public` folder and add the three AJAX methods to make a GET request, POST request, and PUT request. Follow the directions inside the `app.js` file.

    * All the HTML is written. You only need to fill in the JavaScript for the AJAX methods and what goes inside of them.

* Write one method at a time and then test it before moving on to the next.
